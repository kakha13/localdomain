# Getting Started

LocalDomain lets you map custom domains like `myapp.local` to your local dev servers with trusted HTTPS — no terminal commands, no config files.

## First Launch

On first launch, LocalDomain shows a **Setup Wizard** that walks you through three steps:

1. **Install Background Service** — click **Install** and enter your admin/root password. This installs a lightweight daemon that manages your hosts file, proxy, and certificates.
2. **Start Reverse Proxy** — click **Start** to launch the Caddy proxy that routes your domains.
3. **Create Default Domain** — automatically creates `domain.local` so you can verify everything works.

The wizard takes under a minute. Once complete, the status bar at the bottom shows:
- **Daemon: Running** — the background service is active
- **Caddy: Running** — the reverse proxy is ready
- **CA Trusted** — the local Certificate Authority is installed in your system

## Add Your First Domain

1. Click **+ Add Domain** in the top right
2. Enter a domain name, e.g. `myapp.local`
3. Set the target port your dev server runs on, e.g. `3000`
4. Choose the protocol:
   - **HTTP** — plain `http://myapp.local`
   - **HTTPS** — trusted `https://myapp.local` with a green lock
   - **Both** — both HTTP and HTTPS work
5. Click **Save**

That's it. Open `https://myapp.local` in your browser and it works — valid certificate, no warnings.

## Using XAMPP?

LocalDomain also supports XAMPP projects (Apache + VirtualHosts + document roots).

- Set your XAMPP path in the **XAMPP** sidebar page
- Start/stop Apache from LocalDomain
- Scan and import existing `httpd-vhosts.conf` entries
- Create domains in **XAMPP** mode with a document root

Read the full guide: [XAMPP Service](/docs/xampp)

## Managing Domains

- **Toggle on/off** — click the switch next to any domain to enable or disable it without deleting
- **Edit** — click the `···` menu on a domain row to modify its settings
- **Delete** — remove a domain entirely from the same menu
- **Search** — use the search bar to filter domains when you have many

## System Tray

LocalDomain lives in your system tray. You can:
- Toggle domains on/off
- Start/stop services
- See daemon and proxy status
- Close the main window — the app keeps running in the tray

## Share with Anyone

Want to show your local site to someone? Click the **Share** button on any domain row. You have three options:

- **Quick Tunnel** — instant public URL, no account needed
- **Named Tunnel** — persistent URL on your own Cloudflare domain
- **SSH Tunnel** — route through your own VPS

See the [Tunnels](/docs/tunnels) page for details on each type.
