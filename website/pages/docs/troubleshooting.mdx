# Troubleshooting

Common issues and how to fix them.

## Domain not resolving

**Symptom:** Browser shows "This site can't be reached" when visiting your domain.

**Fix:**
1. Check that the domain is **enabled** (toggle is on) in LocalDomain
2. Check the status bar — both **Daemon** and **Caddy** should show "Running"
3. Make sure your dev server is actually running on the target port
4. Try restarting services from the system tray menu

## HTTPS certificate warnings

**Symptom:** Browser shows "Your connection is not private" or certificate errors.

**Fix:**
1. Check the status bar for **CA Trusted** — if it doesn't show, go to Settings and click "Install CA"
2. On **Linux**, Firefox and Chrome use their own certificate stores. You may need to import the CA certificate manually into your browser
3. Try regenerating the certificate: delete the domain and re-add it

## Daemon not starting

### macOS
```bash
# Check daemon status
sudo launchctl list | grep localdomain

# View daemon logs
sudo log show --predicate 'process == "localdomain-daemon"' --last 5m

# Restart daemon
sudo launchctl kickstart -k system/com.localdomain.daemon
```

### Windows
```powershell
# Check service status
sc query localdomain-daemon

# View logs
Get-EventLog -LogName Application -Source localdomain-daemon -Newest 20

# Run daemon in foreground for debugging
target\release\localdomain-daemon.exe --console
```

### Linux
```bash
# Check service status
sudo systemctl status localdomain-daemon

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u localdomain-daemon -f

# Restart daemon
sudo systemctl restart localdomain-daemon
```

## Port conflict

**Symptom:** Caddy fails to start or a domain doesn't work.

**Fix:** Make sure nothing else is using port 80 or 443:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
sudo lsof -i :80
sudo lsof -i :443

# Windows
netstat -ano | findstr :80
netstat -ano | findstr :443
```

If another process (like Apache, Nginx, or IIS) is using those ports, stop it or change its configuration.

## XAMPP Apache not starting (port 80 conflict)

**Symptom:** XAMPP Apache fails to start after enabling LocalDomain, or LocalDomain Caddy fails to start while Apache is running.

**Why it happens:** both services are trying to bind to port `80`.

- LocalDomain HTTP listener defaults to `80`
- XAMPP Apache also often defaults to `Listen 80`

Only one process can own port `80`, so one of them fails.

**Recommended fix:**
1. Change Apache `Listen` to another port (for example `8080`) in XAMPP config
2. Restart Apache
3. Re-scan or refresh XAMPP settings in LocalDomain (it auto-detects Apache port from config)

After this, LocalDomain keeps serving your friendly domains on `80/443` and reverse proxies to Apache on the new port.

For full details, see [XAMPP Service](/docs/xampp).

## Windows SmartScreen warning

The app is not code-signed for Windows. On first launch you'll see a SmartScreen warning. Click **More info** then **Run anyway**.

## Linux CA trust limitations

`update-ca-certificates` covers system tools (curl, wget) but **not** Firefox or Chrome. These browsers use their own certificate stores (NSS). You may need to manually import the CA certificate:

1. Find the CA cert at `/var/lib/localdomain/certs/ca.pem`
2. In Firefox: Settings → Privacy & Security → Certificates → Import
3. In Chrome: Settings → Privacy and Security → Security → Manage certificates → Import
