# Features

A detailed guide to everything LocalDomain can do.

## Custom Local Domains

Create any domain you want and point it to a local port:

| Domain | Target | What it does |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| `myapp.local` | `127.0.0.1:3000` | Your React/Vue/Next.js frontend |
| `api.myapp.local` | `127.0.0.1:8080` | Your API server |
| `admin.local` | `127.0.0.1:4200` | An admin dashboard |

Domains are added to your system hosts file automatically. No need to edit `/etc/hosts` or `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` by hand.

## Trusted HTTPS

LocalDomain creates a **local Certificate Authority (CA)** on your machine and installs it in your OS trust store. Every domain you create with HTTPS gets a real certificate signed by this CA.

**What this means:**
- Chrome, Safari, Firefox, and Edge show a green lock
- No "Your connection is not private" warnings
- No need to click through security exceptions
- Works exactly like a production HTTPS site

**Use cases for HTTPS:**
- OAuth callback URLs that require HTTPS
- Testing cookie `Secure` and `SameSite` attributes
- Service workers (require HTTPS)
- Mixed content issues between HTTP and HTTPS

## Reverse Proxy

Each domain is routed through a reverse proxy powered by [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com). When you visit `myapp.local`, the proxy forwards the request to `127.0.0.1:3000` (or whatever port you set).

This means:
- Your dev server doesn't need to listen on port 80 or 443
- Multiple domains can run simultaneously on different ports
- HTTPS termination happens at the proxy — your dev server stays plain HTTP

## XAMPP Service Integration

LocalDomain integrates directly with XAMPP Apache so you can manage PHP projects and VirtualHosts without editing Apache files by hand.

What you can do:
- Set and auto-detect your XAMPP install path
- Start/stop Apache from the app
- Scan existing `httpd-vhosts.conf` entries and import them
- Create XAMPP-type domains with a document root
- Keep friendly local domains while Apache runs on a non-80 port (recommended)

Important: if XAMPP Apache and LocalDomain both try to use port `80`, one service will fail to start. Keep LocalDomain on `80/443` and change Apache to another port (for example `8080`) so LocalDomain can proxy traffic correctly.

Full setup and internals: [XAMPP Service](/docs/xampp)

## Wildcard Domains

Enable the wildcard toggle on a domain to make all subdomains resolve automatically:

```
*.myapp.local → 127.0.0.1:3000
```

This is useful for:
- **Multi-tenant apps** — `tenant1.myapp.local`, `tenant2.myapp.local` all hit the same server
- **Dynamic subdomains** — your app reads the subdomain from the `Host` header
- **Microservices** — route different subdomains to the same entry point

## Public Tunnels

Share any local domain with the internet. LocalDomain supports three tunnel types:

- **Quick Tunnel** — free random URL via Cloudflare, no account needed
- **Named Tunnel** — persistent URL on your own domain via Cloudflare
- **SSH Tunnel** — reverse port forwarding through your own VPS

Click the **Share** button on any domain row to open the tunnel dialog. See the [Tunnels](/docs/tunnels) page for full details on each type.

## Request Inspector

Click on any domain to open the Request Inspector — a detailed view of all HTTP traffic hitting that domain.

**Table columns:**
- **Time** — when the request was received
- **Method** — GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.
- **Path** — the URL path that was requested
- **Status** — color-coded HTTP status code (green for 2xx, yellow for 3xx, red for 4xx/5xx)
- **Duration** — how long the request took (shown in µs, ms, or seconds)
- **Size** — response body size (shown in B, KB, or MB)

**Detail panel:** Click any row to see the full request details:
- **General** — method, URI, status, duration, size, remote IP, protocol (e.g., HTTP/1.1), timestamp
- **Query Parameters** — parsed key-value pairs from the URL query string
- **Request Headers** — all headers sent by the client
- **Response Headers** — all headers returned by your server

Think of it like the Network tab in browser DevTools, but for all your local domains.

### Access Log Toggle

Each domain has an access log toggle in the Request Inspector toolbar. When disabled, no requests are captured for that domain. Enable it to start logging — useful for debugging or monitoring specific domains without noise from others.

## Audit Log

Every change you make is recorded:

- Domain created, modified, or deleted
- Services started or stopped
- Access logging enabled or disabled
- Timestamp for each action

This gives you a complete history of what happened and when.

## Settings

Access settings from the sidebar. Here's what you can configure:

### General
- **Start on boot** — launch the daemon automatically when your computer starts
- **HTTP Port** — the port Caddy listens on for HTTP traffic (default: `80`)
- **HTTPS Port** — the port Caddy listens on for HTTPS traffic (default: `443`)

### Service Control
- Start or stop the reverse proxy from the settings page
- View the current status of the proxy server

### Certificate Authority
- See whether your local CA is generated and trusted
- **Trust Certificate** button — installs the CA in your OS trust store if it's not already trusted
- You may need to restart your browser after trusting the CA

### Tunnel Defaults
Pre-fill SSH tunnel settings so you don't have to enter them every time:
- **Cloudflare Tunnel Token** — default token for Named Tunnels (manual mode)
- **Default SSH Host** — your VPS hostname
- **Default SSH User** — your SSH username
- **Default SSH Key Path** — path to your private key

### Danger Zone
- **Uninstall** — removes the background service, stops all proxying, and cleans up hosts file entries. Requires confirmation.

## Setup Wizard

On first launch, LocalDomain walks you through a 3-step setup:

1. **Install Background Service** — installs the daemon that manages your hosts file and proxy. Requires your admin/root password.
2. **Start Reverse Proxy** — starts the Caddy proxy so domains can be routed.
3. **Create Default Domain** — creates `domain.local` pointing to `127.0.0.1` so you can verify everything works.

You can skip the wizard and set things up manually, but the wizard handles everything in under a minute.

## Background Service

The daemon runs as a system service:
- **macOS** — launchd (`com.localdomain.daemon`)
- **Windows** — Windows Service (`localdomain-daemon`)
- **Linux** — systemd (`localdomain-daemon`)

It starts automatically on boot (configurable in Settings) and runs with the minimal privileges needed to manage the hosts file and proxy.

## System Tray

LocalDomain lives in your system tray. You can:
- Toggle domains on/off directly from the tray menu
- Start/stop services
- See daemon and proxy status at a glance
- Close the main window — the app keeps running in the tray

## Dark Mode

LocalDomain follows your system theme automatically, or you can toggle between light and dark mode manually in the sidebar.
