│ (/Users/kakha13/Developer/localdomain/website/pages/index.tsx) has a static  │
│ application preview that doesn't effectively demonstrate the key features    │
│ users will experience. This update will create a fully interactive demo that │
│  mirrors the actual user onboarding experience from SetupScreen.tsx,         │
│ showcasing the four most compelling features: XAMPP integration, SSL         │
│ certificates, public tunneling, and domain management.                       │

│ - Current preview is static and doesn't engage visitors                      │
│ - Users don't understand the full power of features until after installing   │
│ - Landing page should mirror the polished, 3-step setup experience users see │
│  on first launch                                                             │
│ - Need to differentiate LocalDomain from competitors by showing, not just    │
│ telling                                                                      │

⏺ I'll implement this comprehensive landing page update using a multi-agent team
   approach. Let me create the team and set up the task structure to parallelize
   the work.

⏺ Now let me create the task breakdown for this multi-phase project:

⏺ Now let me set up the task dependencies to ensure proper workflow:

⏺ Perfect! Now let me spawn the 6-agent team to work on these tasks in parallel:

  - components/FeatureHeroCard.tsx - Expandable feature cards
  - styles/app-preview.css - Interactive preview styling

  Updated Files:
  - pages/index.tsx - Lines 166-219 (preview) & 221-275 (features)
  - styles/landing.css - Hero card styles appended

  The design team is already working on Tasks #1, #2, and #3. You'll start
  seeing their work shortly!


@frontend-developer❯ Ready and waiting for Task #4 approval

⏺ Great preparation, frontend-developer! I can see you've thoroughly reviewed
  all the necessary files and understand the patterns to follow.

  You're correctly blocked - this is the expected workflow. The design team
  (ui-ux-designer and content-designer) are still working on Tasks #1, #2, and
  #3. Once they complete their design work:

  1. Review team will evaluate and score the designs (Task #4)
  2. If approved (≥75/100), you'll be unblocked to start development
  3. You can then implement all three components in parallel with the
  css-specialist

  Your preparation looks solid - you've identified the key patterns from
  SetupScreen.tsx and understand the design system from landing.css. Stand by
  for the design deliverables from the design team.


@content-designer❯ Complete content/microcopy package for demo and hero cards

⏺ Excellent work, content-designer! This is a comprehensive and well-crafted
  content package. Let me mark Task #3 as completed:

⏺ Perfect! Task #3 is now completed. Your content package is outstanding:

  Highlights:
  ✅ Complete step narratives - All 4 steps with realistic timings, status
  messages, and screen reader announcements
  ✅ Compelling hero card copy - Punchy titles with technical depth in hover
  states
  ✅ Comprehensive accessibility - ARIA labels, live regions, keyboard hints
  ✅ Professional tone - Action-oriented, developer-focused, jargon-free

  Current Status:
  - Task #3: ✅ COMPLETED (content-designer)
  - Task #1: ⏳ In progress (ui-ux-designer - interactive mockups)
  - Task #2: ⏳ In progress (ui-ux-designer - hero card designs)
  - Task #4: 🔒 Waiting for #1 and #2, then review team evaluates

  Once ui-ux-designer completes the design mockups and specs, the review team
  will have all three deliverables to evaluate against the 75/100 threshold.
  Great work staying on schedule!


⏺ Idle notifications received - content-designer is standing by.

  Current Team Status:

  Design Team:
  - ✅ content-designer - Task #3 completed, standing by
  - ⏳ ui-ux-designer - Working on Tasks #1 & #2 (mockups and specs)

  Development Team:
  - 🔒 frontend-developer - Ready, waiting for design approval (Task #4)
  - ⏳ css-specialist - Task #7 in progress (preparing for component styling)

  Review Team:
  - 🔒 ux-accessibility-reviewer - Monitoring, will claim Task #4 when ready
  - 🔒 technical-reviewer - Monitoring, will claim Task #4 when ready

  Next Milestone: Waiting for ui-ux-designer to complete design mockups and
  specifications (Tasks #1 & #2), then review team can proceed with the design
  review.


@technical-reviewer❯ Ready for design review, waiting on Tasks 1 and 2

⏺ Excellent preparation, technical-reviewer! You've got a solid understanding of
   the technical constraints and existing patterns.

  Your Technical Review Scope (50 points):
  - ✅ Implementation feasibility (15 pts) - Can it be built with
  Next.js/React/CSS-only?
  - ✅ Performance impact (15 pts) - Bundle size, animation performance, no
  external libs
  - ✅ Brand consistency (10 pts) - Matches existing --ld-* variables and
  SetupScreen patterns
  - ✅ Innovation & polish (10 pts) - Does it differentiate LocalDomain
  effectively?

  Review Process:
  Once ui-ux-designer completes Tasks #1 & #2, you and ux-accessibility-reviewer
   will both evaluate the design deliverables:
  - Your score: __/50 (technical)
  - UX reviewer score: __/50 (usability/accessibility)
  - Combined threshold: 75/100 to approve

  If approved, the development team can proceed with implementation. If not,
  design team will iterate based on your feedback.

  Standing by for Tasks #1 & #2 completion.


@css-specialist❯ Task #7 CSS styling and animations complete

⏺ Excellent work, css-specialist! You've created comprehensive styling ahead of
  schedule. Let me mark Task #7 as completed:

⏺ Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)
  ⎿  Loaded Developer/localdomain/CLAUDE.md

⏺ Excellent! Task #7 is confirmed complete. The CSS is comprehensive and
  production-ready:

  app-preview.css (739 lines):
  ✅ Complete interactive demo layout (titlebar, sidebar, main area)
  ✅ 4-step content styling (domain form, XAMPP panel, SSL progress, tunnel
  card)
  ✅ Status icons (pending/loading/done) with spin/check-in animations
  ✅ Typing cursor blink animation
  ✅ Browser lock color transitions (red→green, 600ms)
  ✅ Tunnel URL reveal (opacity + translateY)
  ✅ Progress dots (8px → 12px on active)
  ✅ Full responsive (1024px, 768px, 480px breakpoints)
  ✅ prefers-reduced-motion: all animations disabled
  ✅ Focus-visible: 2px solid accent outline

  landing.css additions:
  ✅ Hero feature grid (2-column, 20px gap)
  ✅ Card hover: translateY(-4px) + shadow + accent border
  ✅ Screenshot reveal (height 0→120px, opacity, scale)
  ✅ Icon animation placeholders (pulse, color-change, connection, DNS)
  ✅ Mobile: single column, screenshots visible by default
  ✅ Dark mode support

  Design System Compliance:
  ✅ GPU-accelerated only (transform, opacity)
  ✅ Timing: 300ms (quick), 600ms (emphasis)
  ✅ CSS variables: --ld-accent, --ld-success, --ld-bg-elevated
  ✅ Border radius: var(--ld-radius), var(--ld-radius-lg), var(--ld-radius-xl)

  frontend-developer can now use these styles directly when implementing the
  React components. Great proactive work completing this ahead of the component
  implementations!
